    <h2>Description</h2>       
    </p>
    <p>
  A crostata is a traditional Italian tart made with a buttery, crumbly pastry crust and filled with fruit jam or fresh seasonal fruit. Known for its rustic charm, the crostata often features a lattice crust on top and is baked until golden and fragrant. Whether served warm or at room temperature, it's a simple yet elegant dessert that pairs perfectly with a cup of coffee or a scoop of vanilla gelato.

        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>Pinch of salt</li>
        <li>1 to 1 ½ cups fruit jam or preserves (e.g., apricot, raspberry, or cherry)</li>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
         <li>Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C).</li>
         <li>In a large bowl, mix the flour, sugar, salt, and lemon zest (if using).</li>
         <li>Add the cold butter pieces and work them into the flour mixture using a pastry cutter or your fingertips until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.</li>
         <li>In a small bowl, beat the egg and egg yolk with the vanilla extract, then add to the flour mixture and knead gently until a soft dough forms.</li>
         <li>Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.</li>
         <li>On a floured surface, roll out two-thirds of the dough and transfer it to a greased tart pan or baking dish, pressing it into the edges.</li>
         <li>Spread the jam evenly over the dough base.</li>
         <li>Roll out the remaining dough and cut it into strips to create a lattice pattern on top of the jam.</li>
         <li>Bake for 30–40 minutes or until the crust is golden brown.</li>
         <li>Let cool before serving. Optionally, dust with powdered sugar.</li>
