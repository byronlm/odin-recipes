        <h2>Description</h2>
  Pollo al Burro is a classic Italian dish from the region of Emilia-Romagna, especially famous in Florence and Bologna. It features tender chicken, usually breast or thighs, sautéed in butter and often finished with sage, lemon juice, or white wine. The butter creates a rich, velvety sauce that coats the chicken, making it simple yet deeply flavorful. It's typically served with crusty bread or light vegetables.
